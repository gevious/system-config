## Keep workspaces 1-3 on the left monitor, 9-0 on the right
## Home Set up
#workspace $ws1 output DP-0

# uncomment the next line, use arandr to setup displays and save the file as monitor:
#exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/sway/scripts/display-setup
#
## Lock screen after delay (Sway only)
##exec ~/.config/sway/scripts/idle


#### Output configuration
##
## Default wallpaper (more resolutions are available in /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/)
#output * bg /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/Sway_Wallpaper_Blue_1920x1080.png fill
##
## Example configuration:
##
##   output HDMI-A-1 resolution 1920x1080 position 1920,0
##
## You can get the names of your outputs by running: swaymsg -t get_outputs
#
#### Idle configuration
##
## Example configuration:
##
## exec swayidle -w \
##          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
##          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
##          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
##
## This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
## your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
## resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
#
#### Input configuration
##
## Example configuration:
##
##   input type:touchpad {
##       dwt enabled
##       tap enabled
##       natural_scroll enabled
##       middle_emulation enabled
##   }
##
##   input type:keyboard {
##       xkb_layout "eu"
##   }
##
## You can also configure each device individually.
## Read `man 5 sway-input` for more information about this section.
#
#### Key bindings
##
## Basics:
##
#    # Drag floating windows by holding down $mod and left mouse button.
#    # Resize them with right mouse button + $mod.
#    # Despite the name, also works for non-floating windows.
#    # Change normal to inverse to use left mouse button for resizing and right
#    # mouse button for dragging.
#    floating_modifier $mod normal
#
#    # Exit sway (logs you out of your Wayland session)
##
## Workspaces:
##
#    # Note: workspaces can have any name you want, not just numbers.
#    # We just use 1-10 as the default.
##
## Layout stuff:
##
#    # You can "split" the current object of your focus with
#    # $mod+b or $mod+v, for horizontal and vertical splits
#    # respectively.
#    bindsym $mod+b split h
#    bindsym $mod+v split v
#
#
#    # Swap focus between the tiling area and the floating area
#    bindsym $mod+space focus mode_toggle
#
#    # Move focus to the parent container
#    bindsym $mod+a focus parent
##
## Scratchpad:
##
#    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
#    # You can send windows there and get them back later.
#
#    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
#    bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad
#
#    # Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
#    # If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
#    bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show
##
## Utilities:
##
#    # Special keys to adjust volume via PulseAudio
#    bindsym --locked XF86AudioMute exec pactl set-sink-mute \@DEFAULT_SINK@ toggle
#    bindsym --locked XF86AudioLowerVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume \@DEFAULT_SINK@ -5%
#    bindsym --locked XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec pactl set-sink-volume \@DEFAULT_SINK@ +5%
#    bindsym --locked XF86AudioMicMute exec pactl set-source-mute \@DEFAULT_SOURCE@ toggle
#    # Special keys to adjust brightness via brightnessctl
#    bindsym --locked XF86MonBrightnessDown exec brightnessctl set 5%-
#    bindsym --locked XF86MonBrightnessUp exec brightnessctl set 5%+
#    # Special key to take a screenshot with grim
#    bindsym Print exec grim
