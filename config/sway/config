## Workspaces:

#    # We just use 1-10 as the default.

## Layout stuff:
##
#    # You can "split" the current object of your focus with
#    # $mod+b or $mod+v, for horizontal and vertical splits
#    # respectively.
#    bindsym $mod+b split h

## Scratchpad:
##
#    # Sway has a "scratchpad", which is a bag of holding for windows.
#    # You can send windows there and get them back later.
#
#    # Move the currently focused window to the scratchpad
#    bindsym $mod+Shift+minus move scratchpad
#
#    # Show the next scratchpad window or hide the focused scratchpad window.
#    # If there are multiple scratchpad windows, this command cycles through them.
#    bindsym $mod+minus scratchpad show
